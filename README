This object creates versioned urls based on the bobobase_modification_time so that urls can be cached
for a very long time.

First add a CacheVersionURL object and then to use it you call it with

CacheVersionURL.version_absolute_url(yourobject)

CacheVersionURL.version_absolute_url_path(yourobject)
